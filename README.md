# Hello and welcome to my GitHub page 👋🏼🏼
-----------------------------------------------------------
## Who are you 🤨?
I'm Jan! I'm an aspiring Web-Developer which found his passion in coding.

## What are you learning/doing at the moment 🧐?
Tough Question! There are a lot of things I'm currently doin, but I've made a list for you:

- I'm focusing on learning vanilla JavaScript.
- I'm also improving my UI/UX Design skills together with CSS.
- Another thing I'm doing is to network with other developers on Twitter and try to grow a "little" community.
- As a fan of the "Feynman Technique" I'm already trying to mentor/teach developers, which have less knowledge than me.
- When it comes to picking a framework I already made a decision: React. But before learning React I want to have a good knowledge of vanilla JavaScript and how it's working behind the scenes.
## What are your goals 🎯?
- Earning my own money as a Web-Developer in 2021.
- Complate Studying at the University.
- Meeting and getting to know developers all-around the globe.
